Summary
 		This project proposes a movie recommendation system that leverages the TMDB API for data collection and incorporates content-based filtering for personalized recommendations. The system will also include social functionalities, allowing users to create watchlists, review and comment on movies, and interact with each other. Additionally, an "About Us" page will provide information about the system's purpose and development.


The project is divided into several key phases:

TMDB API Integration: This phase involves establishing a connection to the TMDB API to retrieve movie data.

Dataset Collection and Preprocessing: The collected data will be preprocessed to ensure its quality and suitability for the recommendation algorithm.

Content-Based Filtering Implementation: A content-based filtering algorithm will be implemented to analyze user preferences and recommend movies based on similar attributes.

Social Functionalities: The system will incorporate features such as watchlist creation, review and comment capabilities, and user interaction functionalities to enhance the user experience.

About Us Page: An informative "About Us" page will be created to provide users with background information about the system.

This movie recommendation system aims to provide users with a personalized and interactive platform for discovering new movies.
